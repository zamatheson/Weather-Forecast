# Weather-Forecast
This application is a weather forecaster that can be used to access any city's current weather, as well as a 5 day forecast that includes temperature, humidity and a weather icon adjusted to the prediction. When the user types in a city into the input box and clicks search, the application will then log the information from the Open Weather Map API onto the screen for the user to see. The user can also choose from a selection of pre-determined cities. When a user has searched a city, that city will be logged into local stoage.
